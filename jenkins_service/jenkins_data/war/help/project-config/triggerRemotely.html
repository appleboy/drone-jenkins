  Enable this option if you would like to trigger new builds
  by accessing a special predefined URL (convenient for scripts).
  <p>One typical example
  for this feature would be to trigger new build from the source
  control system's hook script, when somebody has just committed
  a change into the repository, or from a script that parses
  your source control email notifications.</p>
  <p>You'll need to provide an authorization token in the form of
  a string so that only those who know it would be able to remotely
  trigger this project's builds.</p>
